# hello-world
for a beginner

This is Cathy, a medical students struggling for coding in R. 
For me, it's a quite long jouney to go but hopefully the first file in Github serves as an auspious begining.
Maybe 3 years later, when I finish my master program and track back to this "README" file, I will be more mature and proficient with R programming, who knows!
